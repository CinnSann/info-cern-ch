    <h2>Equiptment</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Kitchen scale</li>
    <li>Large mixing bowl</li>
    <li>Clean hand </li>
    <li>Bowl scraper</li>
    <li>Bench knife</li>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>525 grams of water (80 &#176;F)</li>
    <li>20 grams salt</li>
    <li>200 grams very active starter</li>
    <li>700 grams all-purpose flour</li>

</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Pour the water into a large bowl.</li>
    <li>Add the ripe starter to the water and mix thoroughly with a whisk or 
        by hand until the floating cloud of starter is mixed completely into the water.</li>
    <li>Add the flour to the leavened water and mix with the dough bowl scraper or other spatula.
        At the end use wet hands to form a shaggy dough ball. </li>
    <li>Let it rest (autolyse stage) about an hour. 
        This stage can be extended without worry up to four hours.</li>
    <li>After autolyse, add the salt to the bread dough. 
        Use your hands to pinch and stretch the dough gently until the salt is mixed into the dough. </li>
    <li>Using your wet hands pull the dough from under the dough ball up and stretch it gently as you 
        pull it over the dough ball top. Release. Repeat this process as you give the bowl quarter 
        turns until the dough is stretched and pulled from each quarter of the bowl.</li>
    <li>Over the next 2 1/2 hours repeat the stretch and fold every 30 minutes for a total of FOUR times. 
        The dough will change from a slimy mass to a billowy dough with many air pockets and body as you 
        stretch and fold it. 
        <br>DO NOT PUNCH DOWN THE DOUGH AT ANY TIME - Those air bubbles create the crumb and flavor. </li>
    <li>Allow the dough to bulk rise IN THE BOWL at room temperature until it rises by 30 percent or
         so.</li>
    <li>Cover the bowl of dough with a plastic bag and set it in the fridge for 12 to 15 hours 
        (overnight). It should continue to rise slowly so give it room in the bowl.</li>
    <li>Remove the dough from the fridge and let it sit on the counter in the bowl until the 
        dough reaches room temperature. The dough will soften and gently rise as it warms. </li>
    <li>Once at room temp, the dough is ready to be divided - On a clean unfloured counter 
        pour out the dough into a large mass. Flour the top of the dough lightly but evenly.</li>
    <li>Divide in half.</li>
    <li>Form each half into a dough ball. The most efficient way to do this is to use the counter 
        as your pivot point. Scrape in a circle around the dough (flour side up). The unfloured 
        counter will hold the dough center and create tension as you circle the dough with the scraper forming a ball.
        Repeat to form two dough balls.</li>
    <li>Let the dough balls rest for 20 to 30 minutes. They will spread out but should not fall flat. If they do, 
        reform the loaves and bench rest them again to build the structure of the dough better.</li>
    <li>Gently slide the dough scraper under one of your dough balls and flip it over so it rests 
        on the floured side.</li>
    <li>Now gently stretch and pull the dough over from the bottom to 1/3 up the loaf. Stretch 
        and pull the dough from the sides to the dough middle. For the final stretch take the 
        dough from the top of the ball and pull it all the way down to the bottom. Form a seam. 
        Pinching the seam as necessary.</li>
    <li>Place the dough seam side up in your floured banneton or bowl.</li>
    <li>Rise in the fridge 2 to four hours.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Baking Instructions:</h2>

<ol>

<li>Set your dutch oven with it's lid on the rack in the lower third of oven. 
    PREHEAT oven to 450 &#176;F. for at least 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove one banneton from the fridge. Place the dough in your preheated
    dutch oven. I do this by flipping it into the dutch oven as gently as 
    possible seam side down.</li>
<li>Score the loaf with your lame knife or a razor blade or sharp scissors. 
    Scoring helps the dough rise better.</li>
<li>Put the lid on the dutch oven and return it covered to your preheated oven. </li>
<li>Bake for 30 minutes at 450 &#176;F.</li>
<li>Now REMOVE the lid. Steam should come out. Hopefully the bread is a light golden 
    color with a nice rise and set crust. Bake an additional 10 minutes UNCOVERED or 
    until the loaf thumps hollowly  at the botton and the surface gets dark
    (caramelized darker than you are used to) and the scored areas look shiny. 
    </li>
<li>Remove the dutch oven. Place the finished loaf on a cooling rack. 
    Do NOT cut it for at least an hour to set the crumb.</li>
<li>Return the dutch oven (with it's lid on) to the oven at 450 &#176;F and preheat 
    for 15 minutes. Repeat the process with the remaining loaf.</li>
<li>To tell if your bread is properly done. Use your digital thermometer and 
    insert it into the center of the loaf. It should read about 205&#176;F</li>
<li>Break and Enjoy!</li>
