# Breaking Bread
### This project is my spin on recreating [the first site on the internet](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)
    - I was instructed to re-create my versions of the 3 key pages on the first site on the internet (TheProject.html,WhatIs.html,Overview.html)
    1. "TheProject.html" saved as "index.html"
    2. "WhatIs.html" saved as "what-is.html"
    3. "Overview.html" saved as "overview.html"
    *with them all being connected through workable links*
#### **A Bit of Context:**
I am a pastry chef, professionally, and over the years my brain has forged a strong correlation between comfort and food. So, to bypass that uneasy beginner learning environment, I often find myself drawing parallels back to food in order to clarify concepts/make "sense"  to my brain and in doing that I find comfort. I am then able to move forward in the learning process because not only have I found comfort, I have also established a connection that will help me apply the new material I am learning(coding); further cementing this material in my brain.

## The concept
I decided to explain how someone would make Sourdough Bread from scratch. 

### index.html
    - This page was dedicated to giving an overview of beginner baker's terms and including links to other useful resources to serve as the intro to baking.
    -Included on this page, as well, is an instruction to make a 'starter' 
    - The 'starter' is the connector link to the what-is.html file
### what-is.html
    - Here I explain what the 'starter' aspect of the sourdough process actually is and how to make one
    - On this page there also a link connecting it to the "overview.html" file redirecting the user to a beginner sourdough loaf recipe
### overview.html
    - Here lies the sourdough recipe formatted properly in HTML


#### I highly recommend trying to make the bread, if you made it through reading this, its yummy! But other than that, this project is just strictly HTML code without any styling and I used it to play around with different HTML elements and layouts. I hope to modify this and apply more styles in the future.

### happy coding <3 (;
