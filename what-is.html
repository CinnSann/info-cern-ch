        Essentially, a starter is a mixture of flour, water, and a bit of patience (aka bacteria from the air).
        It is how we cultivate wild yeast in a form that we can use. 
        <br>Wild yeast is present in all flour and the easiest way
        to access it is by combining the flour and water and letting it sit for days.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        After a couple days, bubbles will start to form in your starter. At this moment the yeast is starting to
        become active and is multiplying, getting stronger. 
        <br>To maintain the pleasant activity coming from the
        yeast, we feed the starter fresh flour and water until it becomes frothy and begins to increase
        in size. Only then is it ready to be used.
