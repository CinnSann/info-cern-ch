    <h1>Breaking Bread: It's the yeast I could do!</h1>
    
    <p>First things first, we've got to make some bread in order to break some bread. 
        The bread we're making over here is artisinal, it's called sourdough. </p>

    <p>Sourdough bread is made by using wild yeast instead of the commercial yeast that you find at the grocer.
        This wild yeast is usually referred to as a <a name="0" href="what-is.html">starter</a> and it is crucial to the development of flavor
        and texture. That link will teach you how to make one at home and you'll want to do that at <i>least</i> five days before you mix your bread.
    </p>

<p>Because sourdough is made with wild yeast, it needs a bit more cajoling. These types of bread are normally mixed, shaped, and baked over 
    the course of a few days. This long, slow development time helps lure out the more complex flavors that make sourdough bread so distinct -- far better
    than your average loaf of sandwhich bread, in my opinion.
</p>

<p>Let’s get started with a short introduction before we dig into how to make sourdough bread. 
    The following standard baking terms and definitions will help us share a common vocabulary and will help you breeze through
    any recipe like a seasoned vet.
</p>

    <h2>Baker's Terms</h2>
<h4>Starter</h4>
         <p>A starter is a mix of flour and water that naturally ferments. You’ll refresh the starter indefinitely. 
    When you want to make bread, you take a small amount of this starter to create an off-shoot or levain. 
            This levain will eventually be used in making bread and cease to exist when baked in the oven.
        </p>

<h4>Levain</h4>
        <p>A levain is made with a small bit of your starter. 
            It’s “built” to set-up the dough with a population of yeast and bacteria. 
            The levain has the same fate as the bread: to be baked in the oven. 
            It is always made with a portion of your starter when the starter is ripe.
        </p>
<h4>Autolyse</h4>
        <p>Autolyse is a step in the baking process where only flour and water are mixed together,
            always at the beginning. Not only does it initiate activity of enzymes in the 
            dough which helps draw out the sugars from the flour, but it also increases its flexibility. 
            You want this: it allows the dough to expand and fill with gasses, resulting in a light and airy loaf.

           for more information on its benefits.
        </p>
<h4>Bulk Fermentation</h4>
            <p>Bulk fermentation is the dough’s first rise. The dough is kept in a single mass and takes place after mixing. 
                This step is critical. During this time, fermentation continues in the main dough as bacteria and yeast
                (from your sourdough starter) begin to generate organic acids and alcohols.
            </p>
<h4>Proof</h4>
            <p>The proof is the dough’s final, or second, rise. Some proof their dough at cold temperature in the refrigerator 
                (also called <a name="0" href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/retarding-427620">“retarding”</a>). 
                Before this time, the divided and shaped in order to continue to ferment, further strengthening the dough 
                and leaving it to replace the air that was taken out by shaping.
            </p>
